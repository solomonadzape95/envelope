# Envelope CLI

Securely share, lock, and open environment variables with asymmetric/symmetric cryptography.

## Install

- From npm (when published):
```bash
npm i -g envelope-cli
```
- From source (this repo):
```bash
npm run prepare
npm i -g .
```
## Quick start
```bash
# 1) Generate your keys (stores locally under ~/.envelope)
envelope gen <username>

# 2) Create envelope_keys file with your public key
envelope share

# 3) Encrypt your .env for yourself or your team
#    Run in the project root where .env exists
envelope lock

# 4) Decrypt and create a local .env
envelope open
```

## Commands
- `envelope gen <username>`: Generate a keypair and store your username locally.
- `envelope share`: Create `envelope_keys.txt` file with your username and public key.
- `envelope lock`: Encrypt `.env` into `.envelope/envelope_enc.txt` and create lockboxes for your team in `.envelope/envelopes.txt`.
- `envelope open`: Decrypt `.envelope/envelope_enc.txt` using your lockbox and write a `.env` in the current directory.

Get help anytime:
```bash
envelope --help
envelope <command> --help
```

## How it works (high-level)
- Public/private keys are stored locally in `~/.envelope`.
- Team public keys are aggregated in `.envelope/envelope_keys.txt`.
- Your `.env` is symmetrically encrypted to `.envelope/envelope_enc.txt`.
- The symmetric key is encrypted per-user (a lockbox) using their public key and stored in `.envelope/envelopes.txt`.
- All envelope-related files are organized in the `.envelope/` folder.
- The decrypted `.env` file is created in the current working directory.

## Troubleshooting
- No banner on install:
  - Ensure postinstall scripts are enabled in your package manager.
  - Run manually: `node dist/post-install.js`.
- Chalk or module errors:
  - Update Node to a recent LTS and reinstall with `npm i -g .`.
- Permission/errors writing files:
  - Ensure youâ€™re in the project directory and `.envelope/` is writable.

## Uninstall
```bash
npm uninstall -g envelope-cli
```
